Provides: a udev rule set appropriate for RHEL7-derived platforms that uniquely names
disks in a Sun X4500 "Thumper" by controller and position within the controller according
to conventions similar to that found under Solaris. The goal is to faciliate the transition
from Solaris (a closed platform) to ZFS on Linux.

This was derived from previous work (noted in solaris-name.sh) found here:

https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Platform-specific_documentation/Sun_Fire_X4500_and_X4540

I have made changes that allow the rules to work in RHEL7-derived platforms and to
account for the fact that my system skips a couple numbers in identifying hard disks
(1,3..49) instead of (0..47) as the website above implies I should find.

I believe that these changes may be X4540 compatible, but I have not verified the claim.

This code is released freely under rules governed by GPLv3.
