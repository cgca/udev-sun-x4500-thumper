This udev rule set is derived from previous work found here:

https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Platform-specific_documentation/Sun_Fire_X4500_and_X4540

I have made changes that allow the rules to work in RHEL7-derived platforms and to
account for the fact that my system skips a couple numbers in identifying hard disks
(1,3..49) instead of (0..47) as the website above implies I should find.

I believe that these changes may be X4540 compatible, but I have not verified the claim.
