Provides: a /etc/zfs/vdev_id.conf file for ZFS on linux to use to create
meaningful names for disks while also identifying them in a way that is
persistent across reboots and failures of individual disks. 

The naming is slightly inspired by Solaris naming conventions in that each
disk is named c${controller_id}t${disk_number_on_controller} followed by
the physical slot location. So it's better than the Solaris naming convention
in that it identifies both controller and physical location. :)

The goal is to faciliate the transition from Solaris (a closed platform) to
ZFS on Linux. This was inspired from previous work by Mark Bergsma found here:

https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Platform-specific_documentation/Sun_Fire_X4500_and_X4540

I have made changes that allow the rules to work in RHEL7-derived platforms and to
account for the fact that my system skips a couple numbers in identifying hard disks
(1,3..49) instead of (0..47) as the website above implies I should find.

The mapping is only valid for Sun X4500 systems. There is an alternative mapping for
X4540s that I hope to soon support.

This code is released freely under rules governed by GPLv3.
